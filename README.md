**In order to change the text values between .xml tags, just choose the language of the .xml that is to be translated, choose the language or languages that you would like to receive , then copy and paste .xml markup into XML Translator Free.**

**This app works, that is why it is available in 92 different languages. It has translated itself! Parsing and translating .xml files has never been easier than it is now, thanks to XML Translator Free. Get ready to enjoy a much easier way to translate!**
